# MAT124 FORTRAN Programs
Some Fortran programs I have written as part of my university course MAT124 : Fortran Programming. I took this course as a COD (Course Outside Department). All of these Fortran sources are compiled and tested in GNU Fortran 95 compiler (Windows Port). Source codes are created, edited and maintained in Code::Blocks IDE.
## Lost Codes
It seems like some of my source code files are lost from my PC. Those programs are very simple ones like demonstrating Loops, variables, Format modifiers etc. They are not where they are supposed to be. I'll upload when I find them, or maybe I'll rewrite those programs.
