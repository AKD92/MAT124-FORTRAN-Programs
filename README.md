# MAT124 FORTRAN Programs
Some Fortran programs from my university course MAT124 : Fortran Programming. All these Fortran programs are compiled and tested in GNU Fortran 95 compiler (Windows Port). Source codes are created and edited in Code::Blocks IDE.
## Lost Codes
I have lost some other Fortran codes, I could not find those in my PC. But I'll try to upload as much as I can to this repository. Sorry for the inconvenience.
