# MAT124 FORTRAN Programs
Some Fortran programs from my university course MAT124 : Fortran Programming. All these Fortran programs are compiled and tested in GNU Fortran 95 compiler (Windows Port). Source codes are created and edited in Code::Blocks IDE.
## Lost Codes
I have lost some other Fortran codes I programmed, I could not find those source files on my PC. But I'll upload sources files whenever I create one or I find one. Sorry for the inconvenience.
